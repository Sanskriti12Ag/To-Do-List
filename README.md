During my Web Development internship at Octanet Services Pvt. Ltd. I made two projects:
1. **A fully responsive landing page using HTML and CSS** </br>
The project involved creating a seamless user experience with a modern, mobile-friendly interface, ensuring optimal performance across various devices and screen sizes.</br></br>

2. **A To-Do List application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript**</br>
This project involves following features:
* Adding a new task along with its due date and assign priority to it (low/medium/high).
* Deleting or Editing any existing task.
* Searching for a task in the list.
* Switch between Light/Dark themes.
* The current day, date and time are also displayed in the application. </br></br>
